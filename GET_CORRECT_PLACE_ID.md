# 🔍 Get Your Correct Google Place ID

**The Place ID from the URL (`0x8339fd9351d14321:0x12a4c39543cf3b5f`) is not the format the API needs!**

## ✅ Solution: Get Canonical Place ID

The Places API needs a **canonical Place ID** (usually starts with `ChIJ...`), not the format from the URL.

### Method 1: Google Place ID Finder (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id
2. Scroll to "Place ID Finder"
3. Enter your business address or search for "Shoreline Web Solutions"
4. Click on your business
5. Copy the **Place ID** (will look like `ChIJ...`)

### Method 2: From Google Maps (Alternative)

1. Go to your Google Maps listing
2. Right-click on your business name/address
3. Select "What's here?" or inspect the page
4. Look for the Place ID in the page source

### Method 3: Use Place Details API to Convert

The current Place ID format might need conversion. We can try using the Place ID from the URL in a different way.
